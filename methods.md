## Methods

### Questionaire
The [quantitive data](results.md) is in the form of a questionaire where I ask various people a set of questions based on scale rating system. Around 15 people were allowed to play the game alone and then required to answer the questions with no influence from other users. I tried to select the people at random and attempted to pick people from different experience levels with games to try and coax out better responses.

### Semi-Structured Interview
The [qualitative data](results.md) is focussed more on information about what the user experienced in the form of a semi-structured interview. This data requires a lot less users and therefore I chose 5, different from the quanititive data users. I sat with the users alone and let them play the game, they were then required to answer several questions all based around the games UI and the problems they may have with it. This data is useful as I can compare and contrast this information with the more general data from the first test.

### Timed Test
The final test I chose to perform consisted of me sitting down with each player (around 5) and timing them how long it took from the moment the game loaded to the moment in which they first used the phone to interact with the world. This test not only helps me to understand how difficult the UI was to interpret but it also helps me to see the types of people that may find it hard and to get feedback from them specifically in future to improve it.
